# Data-Science
Hi my name is Alioune BA and I am from Senegal , West Africa. I am a senior at the Ohio State University in financial Mathematics. I am a huge soccer fan , I play at least 3 times a week.
I am highly interested in everyhting related to data Science. I already have some experience with Matlab and R and I am also currently enrolled in a Professional certificate in data science at HarvardX.
Basically what a data scientist does is use their analyticaland technical capabilities to extract meaningful insights from data. A data Scientis must have good problem solving skills and also good programming skills.
